    This mod includes sexual content. It is only for people who are of age (legally 18+) and can distinguish reality from a video game. 
    This mod is made public for publicity reasons; please do not disseminate it outside the scope of Loverslab.

    Content:

    The pod has ambient sound, so make sure your headsets are working properly.

    Added one new insectoid, called a "Pregnator" as a spawned threat of an insectoid hive. They will try to capture downed human pawns within range and take them
    back to the hive. Victims will be kept alive while cocooned. Wearing apparel can prevent victims from being violated, but apparel will not keep for long in a pod.
    Use at your own risk, and don't ask me why I made this mod, I just needed to face my nightmares.
